# SqrMelon
A tool for keyframe animation & fragment shader management for 64k executables.

## Manual
An extensive PDF can be found in the repo:
https://github.com/trevorvanhoof/sqrmelon/blob/master/SqrMelon%20manual%2022%20April%202018.pdf

## Disclaimer
This tool is provided as-is, feel free to use it, contact me if you have any questions. 

While I am interested in bug reports and willing to help out, I urge you not to rely on me to fix them within small timeframes!

Beware that bugs & feature requests can be "beyond scope".

## Third party
SqrMelon is written with Python2.7 (64 bit) and PyQt4, it also depends on some third party python packages.
It comes with an install.txt with the right download links to help you get started.
The C++ Player project has some other dependencies, listed below:

We included 64klang for music, but adding different synths should be trivial.
SqrMelon/Player/64klang2 already contains the necessary files, but you may find the latest version at:
https://github.com/hzdgopher/64klang

In Release it also calls a post-build step which gives the .exe to kkrunchy to get the compressed final binary.

Get the "a" version and put it in SqrMelon/Player/
